In addition to our statistical consulting and training services MM&B Inc. also builds custom test and measurement systems. If you already have your hardware we can design and build your graphical user interface (GUI) or we can help you determine your hardware needs and then build and deliver a turn-key system.  
  
We specialize in easy to use, intuitive GUIs that integrate all your hardware, test administration, test condition specifications, measurement feedback, and test results reporting needs. Our software capabilities are limited to .NET. We do not use LabView.  
  
Some of the systems that we have built are:  

*   Spherical photometry (light measurement) systems
*   Screen photometry systems
*   Goniophotometers (software only)
*   LED printed circuit board photometric, thermal, and electrical measurement systems
*   Accelerated (by laser) phosphor damage measurement systems
*   Phosphor quantum efficiency systems
*   Cold box measurement systems  
    

We can communicate with most lab devices using one or more of the following communication buses: GPIB/IEEE488, RS232, Ethernet, and USB.  
  
Some of the hardware that we have used on projects includes:
*   Multiprogrammers, e.g. KeySight (formerly Agilent and Hewlett-Packard) 34970A, 34972A, etc.
*   DC Power Supplies, e.g. TDK Lambda, KeySight, Keithley, Rigol, Sorenson, Kepco, etc.
*   AC Power Supplies, e.g. Pacific, California Instruments, Chroma, Kikusui, etc.
*   DC Pulsing Supplies, e.g. AvaTech AVR series   
*   DC SourceMeters, e.g. Keithley 2400 series   
*   Digital Multimeters, e.g. KeySight, Keithley
*   AC Power Meters, e.g. Yokogawa Electric Works (YEW) WT series, Norma, etc.
*   Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator, e.g. KeySight 33120A   
*   Spectrometers, e.g. Optronic Labs OL770, Instrument Systems CAS140, Avantes, Ocean Optics, LabSphere, MacPherson
*   Photometers, e.g. Optronic Labs OL730, LMT, TerraHertz Technologies, Konika-Minolta, GigaHertz Optik, etc.
*   Goniophotometers (custom)   
*   Temperature Controllers, e.g. Arroyo, Accuthermo, Omega/Newport   
*   Laser Power Controllers, e.g. Arroyo   
*   Water Bath Temperature Controllers, e.g. Julabo
*   Arduino  
    

  
All systems are delivered with:
*   An appropriate system validation study and report
*   All source code, fully documented
*   Copies of all mechanical and electrical drawings   
*   A detailed user's guide
*   Hands on training for the staff who will operate and maintain the system
*   Manufacturers' warranties on all purchased hardware
*   One year warranty on the integrated mechanical, electrical, and software systems
*   One year technical support by phone, e-mail, and in person
