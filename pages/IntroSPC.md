---


**Course Description**  
This course was developed for users of statistical process control (SPC) who have little or no formal training in its use. 
Students will learn why SPC is used, why it works, and how to set up, operate, and interpret SPC charts. Attribute charts 
for defectives and defects and variables charts for measurement data will be developed. Hands-on activities will be used to 
demonstrate real problems and solutions. Students will also be introduced to SPC software, gage error (GR&R) studies, and 
process capability studies.  

**Course Format**
This 16 hour course is usually taught in four four-hour sessions.  

**Prerequisite**  
Students must be able to perform basic mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squares, and square roots.
