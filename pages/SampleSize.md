*Sample Size Calculations: Practical Methods for Engineers and Scientists* presents power and sample size calculations for 
common statistical analyses including methods for means, standard deviations, proportions, counts, regression, correlation, 
and measures of agreement. Topics of special interest to quality engineering professionals include designed experiments, 
reliability studies, statistical process control, acceptance sampling, process capability analysis, statistical tolerancing, 
and gage error studies. The book emphasizes approximate methods but exact methods are presented when the approximate methods 
fail. Monte Carlo and bootstrap methods are introduced for situations that don't satisfy the assumptions of the analytical 
methods. Solutions are presented for more than 170 example problems. Solutions for selected example problems using PASS, 
MINITAB, Piface, and R are posted on the Internet.

## Book Review: Willis Jenson, Journal of Quality Technology, Vol. 44, No. 2, April 2012.
TO PUT IT SIMPLY, THIS IS THE BEST SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION BOOK THAT I'VE EVER SEEN. While sample size calculations are 
discussed briefly in many places, it is rarer to find a whole book dedicated to the topic. Those that do exist often have 
a social science or biostatistics emphasis. As the title implies, it truly is a practical, accessible book and is 
comprehensive in its coverage of the wide variety of statistical methods that engineers and scientists often use.

The first chapter describes some of the fundamental concepts behind sample size calculations, such as power and how the 
sample size is impacted by various factors. This provides a nice stage for the remaining chapters which then address s
ample size calculations for various types of analyses. It starts with simpler analysis methods for single samples,
multiple samples, paired data, comparison of standard deviations, regression, and simple proportions. The later chapters 
discuss sample sizes for more complex tools such as multi-factor experiments and resampling methods such as the bootstrap. 
True to its name, it also covers sample size computation for common engineering statistics tools such as response surface 
designs, control charts, process capability, sampling plans and reliability methods.

For each situation that is covered, there is a brief explanation of how the formula is derived which is valuable for one 
who wants to understand in more detail how sample size calculations can be done in general. Citations to the literature 
appear throughout the book and there is a nice bibliography at the end of the book for those wanting even more detail 
than that presented here. I appreciated the fact that the book covers sample sizes for both interval estimation methods 
as well as hypothesis testing so depending on your analysis preference; you'll find what you need. I also appreciated 
that in many cases, the author provides both exact and approximate methods. I share the author's philosophy that in cases 
where exact methods can be challenging to compute, the simpler approximate methods are often a more than adequate substitute.

There are many examples of how the calculations are done for each of the sections, which is very valuable for readers 
wanting to try out a few calculations on their own. There is some discussion of various types of software packages that 
do sample size calculations but the book is not dependent on any particular sample size calculation software. I found this 
to be more useful than the sample size calculation books of Chow et al. (2008) and Dattalo (2008). Chow et al. (2008) focuses 
on sample sizes for clinical trial applications with a more theoretical bent while Dattalo (2008) gives fewer formulas, 
focuses on software and is less comprehensive in its coverage.

This makes for a great reference book to quickly find a formula for a particular situation. It is in a paperback format 
so it is relatively inexpensive compared to many other statistics books. I have referred to it often in the short time I 
have had it and plan to use it often into the future. This is absolutely essential for anyone doing sample size calculations 
and worth every penny. The book may be purchased through amazon.com.
