title: Measurement Systems Analysis and Gage R&R Studies
nav_exclude: true
---


**Course Description:** This course presents an introduction to measurement systems analysis and gage error studies. The 
class starts with a review of basic statistical concepts, then proceeds to discussions of calibration to establish measurement 
accuracy and gage error studies to evaluate measurement reproducibility and repeatability. The fundamental concepts and methods 
of gage error studies are presented using the most common gage error study design - the operator by part crossed design.
Nested designs, gage error short studies, designs with two or more sources of reproducibility, and studies with attribute 
responses are also presented. Different methods of interpreting gage error study results, such as relative to part variation 
and part tolerance, are also discussed.  
  

**Who Should Take This Course:** This course is intended for technicians and engineers who are responsible for designing, 
executing, analyzing, and interpreting gage error studies in their organizations. The course is above the technical level 
of most shop floor operators.  
  
**Prerequisite:** It is recommended that students have completed a quality engineering statistics course but students with 
strong shop math skills and practical experience applying statistical methods in quality engineering situations will also 
be able to complete the class successfully.  
  
**Course Format:** The course requires a total of twelve (12) classroom hours.  

**Software:** Use of statistical software (such as MINITAB) that can design and analyze gage error studies is highly recommended.
