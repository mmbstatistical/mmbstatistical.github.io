title: Sample Size Calculations Course
nav_exclude: true
---




**Course Description:** As companies have discovered the value of data-based decision making methods during their adoption 
of Six Sigma and Lean, they've become more conscious of the need to balance the costs associated with taking too much data 
with the risks associated with taking too few. The purpose of this course is to teach students how to right-size their data collection activities.  

Students of this course will learn how to calculate sample sizes to test and quantify means, standard deviations, proportions, 
and counts. They will learn to apply these methods to data that will be analyzed by linear regression, correlation, designed 
experiments, reliability, statistical process control, acceptance sampling, process capability analysis, and gage error studies. 
Students will use manual calculation methods and software such as Russ Lenth's Piface program 
([www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/](http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/%7Erlenth/Power/)), PASS, MINITAB, and/or R to solve practical sample size problems.

**Who Should Take This Course:** This course is intended for process improvement specialists who work in product or process 
engineering, manufacturing, research, service industry, and business administration operations. The course does not cover 
applications to medical clinical trials or behavioral sciences, although many of the basic methods are the same.  
  
**Prerequisite:** Students should have strong math and statistics skills including an excellent understanding of the calculation, 
use, and interpretation of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. They should also have extensive experience in the use 
of these methods in quality and process improvement activities.  
  
**Textbook:** [Paul Mathews, *Sample Size Calculations: Practical Methods for Engineers and Scientists*](/pages/SampleSizeBook.md).  

Contact Hours: 8 hours (without homework) to 20 hours (with homework)  

**Course Format:** The preferred course format is to present the material in five four-hour sessions with one session per 
week. This gives students time to read and study the methods of the week, to complete homework assignments, to consider 
personal applications of the methods, and to practice solving problems with the software of their choice.
