* p. 47, Example 2.12: Change 504 to 505 in problem statement.
* p. 70, Eq. 3.44, first equation is missing CV in the denominator, should be delta = z_alpha/2 * sigma / CV

* p. 81, Example 4.4: Insert missing minus sign in front of 2.066. Correct interval is (-infinity < z < -2.066)
* p. 83, Example 4.7: In example statement change 8% to 9%, 10% to 5%, and in solution change (0.08,0.10) to (0.09,0.05).
* p. 92, Example 4.12: Replace n = 69, c = 40 with n = 64, c = 37, alpha = 0.0497, pi = 0.9036
* p. 97, last sentence of intro to Section 4.3.2: Omit the final "s" in the word "calculations, that is, "The power calculations for ..." should be "The power calculation for ...".
* p. 98, Example 4.16: Change power in solution from 0.69 to 0.60
* p. 127, Example 5.7: add "log and" before "square root transform"
* p. 152, Example 7.8: Correct rounding error, change n = 39 to n = 40
* p. 154, Eq. 7.47: Missing reference number to Sheskin [60]
* p. 166, Example 8.3: In problem statement, change reference to Eq. 8.6 to Eq. 8.7.
* p. 175, Example 8.9: Change the answer from 0.618 to 0.628
* p. 175, Reference to Burdick [10] should be to a different Burdick reference. See errata for p. 317.
* p, 186: Before Eq. 8.38: Remove the word "conservative"
* p. 194, Example 9.3: Delete the equation number in the solution (9.13). ONLY IN FUTURE EDITIONS!
* p. 197, Example 9.6: Replace 1.645 with 1.96.
* p. 198, Example 9.7: Change the wording to "Find the sample size for an experiment to estimate, ..."
* p. 230-231, Examples 108 and 10.9: Change alpha = 0.05 to 0.10
* p. 231, Eq. 10.33: Change equals sign to approximately equals sign.
* p. 175, 258, 260: Reference to Burdick [10] should be to another missing Burdick reference. See entry for p. 317.
* p. 260: Change df_error = 49 to 48
* p. 270: In Step #5, delete the word "is" in the phrase "is given by the fraction".
* p. 274: Change "When the value of alpha is not specified ..." to "When the value of the type one error rate alpha is not specified ...".
* p. 314: mu_CV should be sigma_x / mu_x
* p. 317, Missing reference to Burdick, Richard K., Connie M. Borror, and Douglas C. Montgomery (2005).
