## Design of Experiments with MINITAB
### Paul Mathews, ASQ Quality Press*, 2004.
### ISBN 0-87389-637-8.

\* ASQ Quality Press was the original publisher but in 2025 I (Paul) reacquired all rights to the book. 
I can have books printed if you need them. The printed books are soft-bound with a simple green cover. 
There is a web link to the free pdf copy below.

Why I Wrote This Book
I wrote this book over a period of about 8 year to supplement the textbooks that I was teaching from. 
I was using the following books:
* Montgomery, Design and Analysis of Experiments
* Box and Hunter, Statistics for Experimenters
* Hicks, Fundamental Concepts in the Design of Experiments  

These are all excellent books, and I still highly recommend them; however, there are many newer books 
today that should be considered.
