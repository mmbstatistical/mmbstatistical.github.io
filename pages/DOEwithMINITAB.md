## **Design of Experiments with MINITAB** <br/> Paul Mathews*, 2004.
\* ASQ Quality Press was the original publisher of the book but in 2025 I (Paul) reacquired all of the rights. 


#### Acquiring Copies of the Book
* There is a web link to the free pdf copy of the book below.
* We can printed copies of the book if you need them. The printed books are soft-bound with a simple green cover. 


#### Why I Wrote This Book
I wrote this book over a period of about 8 years to supplement the textbooks that I was teaching from.
The particular problems I was trying to solve were:
* The textbooks I was using didn't have a good review of core statistical methods, especially for students who hadn't ever or recently had a statistics course.
* Notation varies from book to book. I wanted consistent notation from the introductory chapters through the advanced material.
* Older books weren't written with modern software in mind, so they carried an unnecessary level of detail about DOE calculations.
* The majority of my customers and students use MINITAB so I wanted to include MINITAB-specific instructions.
* I wanted to keep the scope of the book narrow. Montgomery's book, Design and Analysis of Experiments, is one of my favorites; however, 
it's scope is excessive with respect to the needs of students new to DOE methods. I highly recommend that after using
DOE with MINITAB for an introductory course, students should continue their study with Montgomery, Box and Hunter, etc. 


#### Organization of the Material
* Chapters 1-3 provide a review of core graphing and statistical methods and introduce the use of MINITAB
* Chapter 4 is largely qualitative. It provides an introduction to key DOE language and concepts that will be used and expanded in later chapters. 
* Chapters 5-7 introduce one-way and multi-way classification designs, ANOVA, and multiple comparisons tests.
* Chapter 8 introduces linear regression and ANOVA general linear model.
* Chapters 9-11 introduce two-level full-factorial and fractional-factorial designs, and response surface designs.
* The book does not cover advanced topics like repeated measures designs, longitudinal designs, mixture experiments, Taguchi designs, etc. There are
other excellent books available that cover those topics.
